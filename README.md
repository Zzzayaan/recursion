# recursion
This repository contains examples of recursive functions implemented in Haskell

Recursion is a central and fundamental idea in Computer Science and is when functions call themselves from within their own code. Functional programming languages such as Haskell have all sorts of loops implemented with recursion. Recursion is also a useful way of thinking of ways on solving harder problems. Haskell being a purely functional language heavily relies on the use recursion to build programs, which is why you may see that functional programming languages have syntax optimised to handle recursion. In fact, Haskell can handle infinite lists and recursion due its lazy nature.
